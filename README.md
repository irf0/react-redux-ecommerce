# react-redux-ecommerce
I learned redux very well with by building this project
Used React, Redux, Tailwind Css in the frontend and
used Strapi as backend
I can as add as many features as needed but avoided just for time being
My main focus was to learn redux by building this project
Payment feature is yet to be integrated because this concept is not yet completely learnt
But in future definitely I will be building it complete
